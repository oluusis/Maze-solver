# Description

I saw a bachelor's thesis at ÄŒVUT (Czech Technical University) that addressed maze solving in C++. This inspired me to create a maze solver in C#. I used a random algorithm that selects a direction at each intersection to find the exit, leading to different paths each time.

Additionally, my C# maze solver lets me load and save different maps. I can also move elements within the maze, such as walls, the start point, and the end point. This flexibility lets me customize the maze and experiment with various configurations.
